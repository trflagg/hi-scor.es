	<h2>Outside Programming</h2>
		<p>I am very interested in the use of web technology to create cross-platform interactive games. I have been experimenting with games that use AJAX, the HTML5 canvas element, and CSS3 transition/transform properties together for animation and interaction.
		</p>
		<p>
			<strong>Make it So</strong> <a href="https://github.com/trflagg/MiS">https://github.com/trflagg/MiS</a><br/>
			100% JavaScript sci-fi adventure game with a Node.js/Express back end using MongoDB for storage, jQuery and CSS transformations for animation, and Twitter Bootstrap for a responsive cross-platform layout. I started working on it as an excuse to learn Node. It's still in early alpha.

			<strong>Tiny World Machine Inc.</strong> <a href="https://github.com/trflagg/TinyCampbell">https://github.com/trflagg/TinyCampbell</a><br/>
			<strong>Darwin Defenders</strong> <a href="https://github.com/trflagg/DarwinDefenders">https://github.com/trflagg/DarwinDefenders</a><br/>
			Each game was written in 48 hours as part of an online competition. They both were programmed in JavaScript using HTML5 canvas. Darwin Defenders generates its enemies with a genetic algorithm, which is pretty interesting even though the game ended up being rather boring.
