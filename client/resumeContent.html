	<h2>Work Experience</h2>
		<div id="work">
			<div>
				<h3>Scout Exchange - Front-end Developer</h3>
				<p class="workDates">April 2013 - August 2014</p>
				<p>
				I was responsible for all front-end code including CSS stylesheets, JavaScript files, and Jinja HTML web and email templates.The interfaces made heavy use of Twitter Bootstrap, JQuery, and Backbone.js. Our application featured 6 different interfaces integrated as an iframe in our partner's software and a full system administration site.
				</p>
				<h4>UI Build System</h4>
				<p>
				I designed and implemented a UI-build system to speed up and simplify our front-end code. I incoroporated SASS for cleaner CSS code and dependency control, integrated RequireJS for JavaScript dependency control, and used Grunt to package our library and custom code into single files -one per interface. I reduced our file accesses from about 20 files per page to 3, speeding up response time and drastically reducing our bandwidth.
				</p>
				<h4>Full stack</h4>
				<p>
				Though my title was front-end developer, I worked on the entire application stack involved in the design and programming on the back-end. Most of the code was in Python using the Flask framework, MongoDB, and the mongoengine package. We used agile development practices and had 100% unit test code coverage. I also took my turns in production support and helped with system administration. The application was hosted with NGINX on an Ubuntu server running on Amazon's EC2.

I was responsible for design and development of new applications, ongoing management of the existing applications (bug fixes, special requests, etc.), and system administration of the host linux servers. In addition, I served as technical coordinator for a number of projects persued by the Social team.
			</p>

			<h3>InterSystems Corporation - Technical Trainer</h3>
				<p class="workDates">February 2007 - June 2010</p>
				<p>
					With my experience as a teaching TA, I was hired at InterSystems as a Technical Trainer. I taught courses in object-oriented programming, web programming, and system management both in our classroom in Cambridge and at customer sites around the world.
				</p>
				<h4>Zen Programming Course</h4>
				<p>
					I built a 3&ndash;day training course based on InterSystem's web programming technology. I developed the entire course including agenda, lecture-slides, and exercises.

	<h2>Outside Programming</h2>

			<h4>Make It So</h4>
				<p>
					I am currently working on a single page web application disguised as a sci-fi adventure game. The back-end is written in JavaScript using Node.js, the Koa framework, and MongoDB. The front-end uses Backbone.js, SASS, and the doT template engine.

			<h4>JavaScript games</h4>
				<p>
					I have participated in Ludum Dare which challenges participants to make a game in 48 hours. Each game is written in JavaScript and runs directly in the browser. P27 uses SVG and CSS3 animation so that it scale to any device size. The other three use HTML5 canvas drawing and different game libraries. Darwin Defenders generates its enemies with a genetic algorithm (which is pretty interesting even though the game ended up being rather boring).
